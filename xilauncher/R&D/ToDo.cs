        //      should provide a UI that indicates which files/folder are present and which launcher modules are available
        // * this would achieve the same as CLI argument would, though having CLI would be neat
        // * still need to fix release build not having proper paths (will be easier with the checker described above)


        //  add config for servers (use params for xiloader as data set)
        //  add cli argument support to allow starting server or game with a single command
        //                  * server should startup as is (for the future it might be a thing to inculde configurator for the server settings)
        //                  * game should launch with a configurable default account

        //  ponder about:   * database tools/options to export account or character?
        //                  * options to control FFXI startup (windowed vs fullscreen, resolution, etc)
